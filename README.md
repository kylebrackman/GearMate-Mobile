# Welcome to GearMate ðŸ‘‹

## About the Project

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

GearMate is an application where users can rent out various types of gear, games, or hardware, that others may just need for a few days, or just want to test out! Currently, to rent outdoor gear, outdoor enthuiasasts must go to a large, corporate, recreational store to rent out low quality equipment for too high of prices. Now, people can rent out their gear to whoever may need it!

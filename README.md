# Welcome to GearMate ðŸ‘‹

## About the Project

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

GearMate is an application where users can rent out various types of gear, games, or hardware, that others may just need for a few days, or just want to test out! Currently, to rent outdoor gear, outdoor enthusiasts must go to a large, corporate, recreational store to rent out low quality equipment for too high of prices. Now, people can rent out their gear to whoever may need it!

### Backend
To view the backend, please visit the [backend repository](https://github.com/kylebrackman/GearMate). This includes both the backend, built with Ruby on Rails and Postgres, and the Web App frontend, which is still under construction and built with React. 

The backend is currently deployed through Heroku and the Web App is deployed through Vercel.

### Tentative Release Date: January 2025
A small group of beta testers will have exclusive access to the app in January, 2025.
